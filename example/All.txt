ACT 1
病中求学
Pursue Study in Illness

吴铁口
求卜问卦 
Wutiekou
Performing a divination I read the omens

定乾坤
and cast a hexagram to determine the faith of heaven and earth

祝英台
我心求学志可遂 何处能将答案寻
Zhu Yingtai
I can I pursue my study  Who shall I go for answers

银心
小姐 那边有位算命先生
Yinxin
My lady, there is a fortune teller

我们去问问他吧
I think we should go ask him.

祝英台
哦 道长 我想问
Zhu Yingtai
O, Taoist master, I want to ask

吴铁口
莫要开口
Wu Tiekou
I know what you want

贫道已然知晓
the great one sees it all

你所求者 乃是一段姻缘 一位如意郎君
You seek a husband 

祝英台与银心
不对
Zhu Yingtai and Yinxin
No

吴铁口
哦 贫道明白了 二位定是为求子嗣而来
Wu Tiekou
Now I know! Surely you came here for your child

祝英台与银心
不对
Zhu Yingtai and Yinxin
No

吴铁口
啊哈 你们定是来问财运的 此乃人心所向 必不会错
Wu Tiekou
Aha! You came here for fortune, this must be what your heart desires.

祝英台与银心
不对
Zhu Yingtai and Yinxin
Noo

祝英台
我们走吧 我看他也没什么本事
Zhu Yingtai
let's go, I don't think he's great after all 

吴铁口
哎 回来 贫道已有答案
Wu Tiekou
Hey! Come back! I now have the answer

我知道了 是你们心不诚
I know the reason! you are not sincere

须得敞开心扉
you must be open 

贫道方能知晓尔等所求
then I will be able to know what you want

吴铁口
现在 闭上双眼 随我调息
Wu Tiekou
now close your eyes and breathe in

吸气
take in the air around us

呼 呼 呼
Breathe in, in, in 

吴铁口
吸气 吸 吸 
Wu Tiekou
Breathe in, in, in

呼 呼 呼

吴铁口
哎呀 我的衣裳 救命啊 救命 救命
Wu Tiekou
Oh，my clothes, help! help! help! 

祝员外
我乃是恪守礼仪的祝家人 
Zhu Gongyuan
I am a Zhu, a man of strict propriety

方圆百里好名声
renowned for miles around

吾家有女名英台  
My daughter, Yingtai, now sixteen

年芳二八太任性 
is willful beyond reason

不留深闺待出阁
Instead of staying secluded, awaiting marriage

却为诗书去杭城
she craves books and Hangzhou

祝员外
哎 她可知 
Zhu Gongyuan
Ah! Does she not know

乃祝家千金女  
A Zhu maiden, venturing out

抛头露面辱门庭
brings shame upon our house

有心不让杭城去
My heart denies her

又怕她病势转深沉
yet I fear her sickness may deepen

唉 这可如何是好啊
What is to be done

银心
员外 依银心之见啊
Yinxin
Sir, if I may suggest

倒不如让卜卦先生来卜个卦
perhaps we consult a diviner

以解疑难
To resolve this dilemma

祝夫人
有道理 员外
Lady Ten
Wise words, husband

不妨一试
Let us try

银心
哎呀 卜卦先生等候多时 有请卜卦先生。
Yinxin 
Ah! The diviner awaits. Please, enter

祝英台扮演的卜卦人
请问员外 有何疑难问卦
Yingtai (as Diviner)
What perplexity brings you to seek the oracle, sir?

祝员外
只因小女想去杭城读书 是我不允 
Zhu Gongyuan
My daughter wishes to study in Hangzhou.I forbade it  

为此小女抑郁终日 得了一病 
She pined, fell ill. 

未知吉凶如何 特请先生一卜 
I seek to know her fortune. Is it auspicious?

祝英台扮演的卜卦人
如此 待我卜来 哎呀 员外 
Yingtai (as Diviner)
So be it. The shells shall speak. Ah, sir

按卦而断 
The signs declare

小姐在家多灾多病啊
at home, your daughter faces misfortune and lingering sickness

出门可以除病消灾 
But a journey would dispel her ills

到杭城读书么 
To study in Hangzhou

更是大吉大利
Most auspicious

祝员外
如此说来 这杭城去得
Zhu Gongyuan
Then... she may go

祝英台扮演的卜卦人
去得
Yingtai (as Diviner)
She may

祝员外
多谢先生
Zhu Gongyuan
My thanks, Master

祝英台扮演的卜卦人
多谢爹爹 哈哈 哈哈
Yingtai (as Diviner)
My thanks... Father! Ha, ha

爹爹 我是女儿英台啊
Father, it is I, your daughter Yingtai

祝员外
英台
Zhu Gongyuan
Yingtai

祝英台扮演的卜卦人
爹爹 女儿乔装男子 
Yingtai (as Diviner)
See, Father? Disguised as a scholar

一无破绽
not a flaw detected

你现在总可让女儿出门读书了吧
Now you must let me go

祝员外
去 多嘴 英台 想你是裙钗之女
Zhu Gongyuan
Hush, child! You are a maiden

怎可抛头露面远走杭城
How can you roam so far, exposed to all

祝英台
古时有曹大家 蔡文姬
Yingtai
In ancient times, Ban Zhao and Cai Wenji

都是一代才女留名千古
were celebrated scholar-poets, their names etched in history

难道孩儿，难道孩儿就学不得如他们么
Shall I not follow in their footsteps

祝英台
爹爹 恳求爹爹放儿行
Yingtai
Father! I beg you, grant me this 

待等三年学成后
When three years pass, my studies done

伺奉爹爹尽孝心
I shall return to serve you with all devotion

倘若爹爹不应允 女儿长跪不起身
If you refuse... I shall kneel here, and never rise

祝夫人
如何不是天意
Lady Teng
Husband, let her go

而且你想我们晋朝位高权重的谢家和王家
Consider the powerful Xie and Wang families of our Jin dynasty

哪个不是书香门第 家学渊博
—true houses of learning, their reputations built on letters 

如果我们女儿继续读书 识些诗文
Should our daughter deepen her studies,

得些如谢道韫般咏絮之才的名声
gain renown like Xie Daoyun for her "willow catkin verse" 

他日媒婆说亲时 能结到的士家大族不也更好吗 
would not her prospects for a noble match be greatly enhanced

祝员外
哎 哎 哎 你起来呀
Zhu Gongyuan
Ai, ai, ai... Rise, child

祝英台
爹爹
Yingtai
 Father

银心
员外 小姐假扮书生 连员外都认不出自己的亲生女儿
Yinxin
My Lord, her disguise even fooled you, her own father 

依银心之见啊 还是让小姐出门读书的好
In my view, let the young mistress go

祝员外
我女儿假扮书生倒是像 好吧好吧
Zhu Gongyuan
My daughter plays the scholar well enough...Very well

就由了你的性子
You may have your way

但你要允我三件事
But you must promise me three conditions

祝英台
爹爹请讲
Yingtai
Name them, Father

祝员外
一 你此去乔装男子 
Zhu Gongyuan
First, maintain your disguise

可不要露出破绽
Let no one see through it

祝英台
嗯
Yingtai
Yes

祝员外
二、三年学满务须速归
Zhu Gongyuan
Second, once your three years end, return without delay 

三 倘若家有要事 一见家书
Third, if urgent word is sent from home

即速归来
you must come back at once

祝英台
就依爹爹 如此 女儿去也
Yingtai
I promise! Then, Father, I take my leave

银心
员外 虽说我貌美 
Yinxin
My Lord, though I lack her strength

身子柔弱 不如小姐这般强壮那么像男人
and seem too fair and frail to pass as a man

但是我从小与小姐一同长大
I have been her companion since we were small

小姐此次前去杭州 少不得要人使唤
The young mistress will need a serving hand on this journey

银心愿改装前去
I, too, wish to go in disguise

祝公远
我也不知道这样做对不对，我心底有种不祥的预感
Zhu Gongyuan
I truly don't know whether this is the right thing to do. I have this ominous feeling in my heart.

滕氏
我们孩子大了，也很聪明，就让她去吧，静待她学成归来，为他寻个更好的夫婿
Madam Teng
Our child is grown and clever. Let her go. We'll simply wait for her to finish her studies and then find her a better husband.

祝英台
终于可以看看外面的世界了！
Zhu Yingtai
At last, I can finally see the outside world!

银心
那小姐，你看吧！！！
Yinxin
My lady, look over there!

ACT 2
草桥相会
Meeting in the Grass Bridge

梁山伯
离故乡 别亲友
Liang Shanbo
From home I've come, from kin I part

求学杭城
To seek my studies in Hangzhou afar

一路上 阅尽了
Along the road, the springtime smiles

春色满乾坤
The earth in bloom, the air beguiled

蝴蝶翩翩河边飞
Butterflies dance by rivers clear

草木清风亦醉人
The breeze is drunk with fragrance near

山伯本是一介布衣
I, Shanbo, born of humble clay

庸碌却难慰平生
Would follow sages, seek the Way

读书从今效先贤 发奋苦学
Through toil and books, to earn my name

求取功名
And light the honor of my fame

祝英台
春风化雨云飞扬
Zhu Yingtai
The spring wind whispers, clouds drift by

心随燕子任翱翔
My heart takes wing as swallows fly

花样年华诗书中
At youth's fair hour I donned a gown

英台成了读书郎
And turned from girl to scholar-brown

红颜一洗铅华尽
The rouge has faded from my face

素面朝天凤作凰
My brush shall earn me phoenix grace.

草桥上面一书生
Upon the bridge—a scholar stands

白衣飘飘风骨神
His robe of white, so pure, so grand

梁山伯
草桥下面一书生
Liang Shanbo
Beneath the bridge—a scholar too

玉树临风正青春
Refined in form, of spirit true

祝英台
他执扇横在手
Zhu Yingtai
He holds his fan with gentle hand

淳朴潇洒且斯文
So calm, so bright, so mild, so grand

梁山伯
他玉扇扑蝶儿
Liang Shanbo
He stirs his fan to chase a butterfly

机灵活泼目含春
With lively eyes that gleam with sky

在下梁山伯
I am Liang Shanbo

公子是
And you, good sir

祝英台
原来是梁公子 小姓祝 名英台
Zhu Yingtai
A pleasure. I am Zhu Yingtai

梁山伯
原来是祝公子 敢问祝公子前往何处
Liang Shanbo
Ah! Master Zhu! May I ask—where are you bound

祝英台
前往杭城读书求学
Zhu Yingtai
To Hangzhou, to study and to learn

梁山伯
巧了 我也是
Liang Shanbo:
How rare a chance! I travel there as well

梁山伯&祝英台
敢问公子前往何处求学
Liang Shanbo&Zhu Yingtai
And where shall you study

梁山伯&祝英台
尼山书院
Liang Shanbo&Zhu Yingtai
At Nishan Academy

巧了 我也是
How strange! The same! By fate, the same

银心
巧极了 小姐
Yin Xin (aside)
How marvelous, the same! my lady

梁山伯
小姐
Liang Shanbo
Lady

银心
哦不 公子
Yin Xin
—ah, I mean, my Master

祝英台
小姐 小姐好端端在家 提她做什么
Zhu Yingtai
Ha! The lady stays at home. Speak no such thing

银心
哦 我想让小姐也能一同出来读书那就好了
Yin Xin 
Ah—indeed. I merely wished the lady could study as well

梁山伯
敢问祝公子 莫非令妹
Liang Shanbo:
Master Zhu, might I ask—was that your sister you spoke of

祝英台
公子有所不知
Zhu Yingtai
You have sharp ears, good sir

我家有个小九妹
Indeed, I have a younger sister,called Jiumei 

聪明伶俐人钦佩
With talents rare and spirit fine

描龙绣凤称能手
Her needlework like dragon's flight

琴棋书画件件会
Her lute and verse both bring delight

我此番杭城求名师
She wished to seek a master's art

九妹一心想同来
To Hangzhou she had set her heart

我以为 男儿固须经书读 女儿读书也应该 
I hold that sons and daughters share.The selfsame right to learning fair

只怪我爹爹太固执
But Father, stern, would not comply

终于留下小九妹
So at home my little sister must lie

梁山伯
妙哉高论 妙哉高论
Liang Shanbo
How noble! How refined

公子宏论令人敬
Your words have truly stirred my mind

志同道合称我心
How rare to find a friend so true,Who sees what women may pursue 

男女同是父母生
Since we are born of parents same

女儿也该读书求学问
Should not both seek the scholar's name

祝英台
承蒙公子夸奖
Zhu Yingtai
Your praise does honor me

我以为天下男子一般样
Most men think women worth far less

难得你也为女子抱不平
But you, Liang, are different，speaks for women

梁山伯
山伯求学 想不到竟遇上良朋益友
Liang Shanbo
I came for knowledge—what a grace

祝公子 今有幸
To find a friend in time and place

得遇公子心欢喜
Dear Zhu, my heart feels light and free

意欲与你两结拜 不知公子可愿意
Would you swear brotherhood with me

祝英台
承蒙公子不见弃
Zhu Yingtai
You do me honor, I agree. Let's pledge in kinship, you and I

金兰结义为兄弟。
To study side by side, and high. In fellowship our days go by. An honor beyond measure!

从此读书有良伴
From this day forth, let us study side by side

英台哪有不愿意
How could Ying Tai refuse

梁山伯
如此 敢问祝公子贵庚
Liang Shanbo
Then tell me, your age, good brother

祝英台
英台二八
Zhu Yingtai
Eighteen this year

梁山伯
山伯一十七岁
Liang Shanbo
And I, seventeen

祝英台
有道是长者为兄
Zhu Yingtai
Then as the saying goes:The elder shall be brother

梁山伯
幼者为弟
Liang Shanbo
the younger, kin

祝英台
从此英台有了一位兄长
Zhu Yingtai
Then Ying Tai gains a brother today

梁山伯
山伯从此有了一位贤弟
Liang Shanbo:
And Shanbo earns a kindred soul.

祝英台
兄长
Zhu Yingtai
Esteemed elder Brother

梁山伯
贤弟
Liang Shanbo
Dear younger Brother

祝英台
兄长
Zhu Yingtai
Esteemed elder Brother

梁山伯
贤弟
Liang Shanbo:
Dear younger Brother

祝英台
诶 只是你我结拜 何以为证啊
Zhu Yingtai
But wait—what token shall we bear

梁山伯
这 你我求学 草桥相识
Liang Shanbo
Here where the academy's road we trace

不妨 在这草桥上结拜
Let's pledge our bond in this green space

让那双飞的蝶儿为我们做个证
And let these butterflies in air. Be witnesses to oath we swear

梁山伯&祝英台
日月山川 万物荣欣
Liang Shanbo & Zhu Yingtai
By sun and moon, by stream and hill, By life that flows through every rill

山伯英台 草桥结拜
Shanbo and Yingtai, here we vow

从此以往 拜为兄弟
Brothers in heart, in word, and brow

对天盟誓
Heaven be witness, earth attest

蝴蝶为证
Butterflies guard this oath confessed

银心
天乃蝶之家
YinXin
The sky—the butterfly's own dome

地乃蝶之灵
The earth—the place from which they roam

云乃蝶之裳
The clouds—the robes on wings they wear

花乃蝶之魂
The flowers—the soul they breathe in air

但为君之故
All for the sake of love's true call

翩翩舞到今
They dance till dusk, and beyond all

关关雎鸠，在河之洲
Kwan-kwan" go the ospreys, On the islet in the river.

祝英台
那就是尼山书院了！
Zhu Yingtai
That must be the Nishan Academy!

梁山伯
是了，你我兄弟二人，以后就可以在此读书相伴了
Liang Shanbo
Indeed. From now on, we brothers can study here side by side.

ACT 3
竹林学琴
Learning Guqin in Bamboo Grove

祝英台
各位同窗 我坐哪
Zhu Yingtai
Fellow students, where may I sit

亭望春
不知何处坐 不知如何自处
Ting Wangchun
know not where to sit, nor how to conduct yourself

我问你 君子行则思气道 饮必思其源
Let me ask you: A noble man, in travel, thinks of his path; In drinking, thinks of its source.

你是如何来尼山书院的
How did you come to Nishan Academy

祝英台
我是走来的
Zhu Yingtai
I walked here

不对先坐车后走来的
Wait, no—first by carriage, then on foot

亭望春
乘车而至啊
Ting Wangchun
Riding a carriage

那就在后排择一个位子吧
Then take a seat in the back row

亭望春
慢着
Ting Wangchun
Hold on

君子施必石其量，用必思其器
In giving, a gentleman sets firm measure; in using, he reflects on the proper tool.

那你坐的车是牛车呢 还是马车呢
So, was it an ox cart or a horse carriage

祝英台
马车
Zhu Yingtai
Horse carriage

亭望春
那可以坐前三排
Ting Wangchun
Then you may sit within the front three rows.

这马车是一匹马拉的还是两匹马拉的
Was it pulled by one horse or two

祝英台
是两辆马车 三匹马
Zhu Yingtai
Two carriages, three horses

亭望春
那再坐前两排
Ting Wangchun
Then please move to the front two rows

亭望春
行李多少箱
Ting Wangchun
How many trunks of luggage

祝英台
十箱
Zhu Yingtai
Ten trunks

亭望春
书童几个
Ting Wangchun
How many page boys

祝英台
没书童 只有十个仆人 一个丫鬟
Zhu Yingtai
No page boys. Only ten servants and one maidservant

群弟子
望春同学 起来
All Disciples
Classmate Wangchun, up you get

你坐后一排
Move to the back row 

位子让给祝同学坐
this seat is for Classmate Zhu now

祝英台
不用不用 我到梁山伯旁边坐
Zhu Yingtai
No need, no need! I'll sit next to Liang Shanbo.

梁山伯
这里凉快
Liang Shanbo
It's cooler here

亭望春
寒门也怕热吗
Ting Wangchun
Is the Hanmen-poverty-stricken class afraid of the heat too

不走哪都凉快吗
Hanmen Hanmen, I thought wherever Hanmen go, wherever is cool

祝英台
原本不热的
Zhu Yingtai
I wasn't hot until heard your words

听你的话替你臊得热
Now I'm flushed with shame for you

周士章
停停停
Zhou Shizhang
Stop! Stop! Stop

君子之操
A gentleman's conduct lies in serenity

在于淡泊明德 宁静致远
that leads to greatness,pursuing the integerity while despising the fame

方才你们一个个攀比门第
However, each of you just now is so eager to compete over family background

真是太不像话了
this is utterly disgraceful and shameful

好了 我们开始上课了
Enough. Let us begin today's lesson

君子六艺 乐为其一
Among the Six Arts of gentlemen, music holds sacred place

乐有众器 以琴为尊
Of all instruments, the qin reigns supreme

今日为师带大家学习的正是《高山流水》
Today, I shall teach you 'High Mountains, Flowing Streams

文灏 先为你同学弹一下
Wen hao, You play Mountain first for your classmate

陆文灏
是
Lu Wenhao
Yes, teacher

祝英台
当年伯牙鼓琴 志在高山
Zhu Yingtai
When Boya played of mountains

钟子期曰
Zhong Ziqi praised

善哉 峨峨兮若泰山
'How majestic like the great mountain'

志在流水
When his tune turned to rivers

子期曰 善哉 洋洋兮若江河
Ziqi praised: 'How boundless like the torrential river

梁山伯
子期死后 伯牙破琴绝弦
Liang Shanbo
After Ziqi's death, Boya broke his qin,

终身不复鼓琴
vowing never to play again

道 世无足复为鼓琴者
'For none remain would understand my music

祝英台
伯牙虽破琴绝弦
Zhu Yingtai
Though he destroyed his instrument,

却成就了千古流传的佳话
their friendship became legend.

小弟对这样的知音之交 甚为羡慕
How I envy such spiritual friendship

梁山伯
贤弟无需羡慕
Liang Shanbo
Dear brother, why envy

你我二人便是这样一见如故的知己
Are we not kindred spirits who bonded at first sight

祝英台
我兄说得有道理 得遇梁兄 幸甚至哉
Zhu Yingtai
Well said, Elder Liang. Meeting you is my greatest fortune

琴瑟在御 莫不静好
Where qin and se play in accord, all remains calm and fair.

周士章
好了 众位和文灏一起弹吧
Zhou Shizhang
Now, play with Wenhao

亭同学 琴声要清 微 淡 远 你要寄托心志在上面
Stop! The qin demands clarity, subtlety, detachment and serenity

不是在拨木头啊
not wood-chopping

亭望春
先生 学生只是初学 
Ting Wangchun
But Teacher, I'm just a beginner

周士章
所谓琴者 诚可以感荡心志 而发泄幽情矣
Zhou Shizhang
The qin stirs souls and release one's innermost feelings!

你弹得简直毫无情绪 寡淡如水
Your playing is totally emotionless 

亭望春
我觉得弹得挺好的啊
Ting Wangchun
I am good at it, it sounds pleasant to me

周士章
你弹得这样差劲 声音虚薄缠绵 满是女儿家之气
Zhou Shizhang
Your feeble, wavering notes reek of maidenly weakness

祝英台
先生 有句话我不知当讲不当讲
Zhu Yingtai
Teacher, with respect

亭望春
你竟然会帮我
Ting Wangchun
You're defending me

祝英台
他弹得的确差 却不当以女儿家作比
Zhu Yingtai
His playing is poor, but why compare it to women

女儿家弹得琴未必就差
Many women are not necessarily worse than men at playing the Guqin

亭望春
你竟然说我不如女人
Ting Wangchun
You dare say I'm worse than a woman

先生的话你也敢反驳
And contradict our Master

祝英台
先生 学生不是这个意思
Zhu Yingtai
I meant no disrespect

只是想说把女儿家和琴声联系在一起对女子不太公平
only that linking poor skill to femininity is unjust

梁山伯
先生 贤弟最近读了些蔡文姬的《悲愤诗》
Liang Shanbo
Master, my friend recently studied Cai Wenji's Poem of Grief 

又常常赞扬她所作的《胡笳十八拍》
and admires her Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute

想来是如此才会发出感慨来 绝非亭兄所言 意图对先生妄加反驳
His comments stem from scholarly admiration—not defiance

而且贤弟所言不错 春秋庄姜 东汉班昭
And indeed, history honors brilliant women like Zhuang Jiang of Qi, Ban Zhao of Han

乃至我朝名士谢安侄女谢道韫皆是世人称颂的才女
and our own Xie Daoyun

她们聪明颖慧 风华绝代 即便男子也是敬佩有加
Even men acknowledge their genius

祝英台
梁兄
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Xiong

周士章
梁山伯 我见方才众人在争排座位
Zhou Shizhang
Liang Shanbo, while others quarreled over seats

你却一直淡然安定的坐着 不卑不亢
you remained composed 

能告诉我你的想法吗
Why

梁山伯
先生 求学之本意不在座位之序 门第高低
Liang Shanbo
True learning cares not for seating or status

在于忧国忧民 匡扶社稷
but for serving the people and nation

我不管坐哪里 都能为这天下百姓江山社稷尽一份力
Any seat suffices to cultivate virtue.

周士章
你弹一下《流水》与我听
Zhou Shizhang
Play Flow Water for us

翩绵飘邈 微音迅逝 远而听之 若鸾凤和鸣戏云中  迫而察之 若众葩敷荣曜春风
Notes soar like phoenixes dancing in clouds, yet bloom gentle as spring breezes through blossoms...

梁山伯 你弹的很好
Liang Shanbo, you play very well

亭望春
有什么了不起
Ting Wangchun
What's so great 

众弟子
那你有什么本事？
All Deciples
What can you do?

==
我乃会稽望门来，不读诗书也有财
看我日日饮酒歌，贫门草户低眉来
From Kuaiji's gates I stride with pride; No books I read, yet wealth's my guide.
I drink and sing through idle days,While poorer homes but bow their gaze.
==

==
不学无术何足惧，自有爹爹把官台
平生所务为何事，朝敷粉来夕宴陪
寒门笑我太疏狂，我笑寒门无路开
待我再攀青云枝，人人称赞美郎才
No craft I fear, for rank is mine;My father's post secures my line.
At dawn I paint, at dusk I feast,A courtly life, from west to east.
They call me wild—I laugh in turn;Their narrow path leaves no return.
But once I climb the azure tree,All men will praise my gifted spree
==

周士章
吹嘘！吹嘘！你就知道吹嘘！给我好好练！
Zhou Shizhang
Bragging Bragging, all you know is bragging, practice more until you master the skill!

祝英台
活该
Zhu Yingtai
Derserved it

梁山伯
贤弟，你幸灾乐祸呀
Liang Shanbo
Brother, you're rather pleased with his misfortune, aren't you?

祝英台
梁兄，你看他！
Zhu Yingtai
Liang, just look at him!

==
我乃会稽望门来
不读诗书笨脑袋
平生所务为何事
吹牛吹牛吹大牛
I hail from a noble gate of Kuaiji.
I never read the classics—my head stays dull.
What is it that I pursue in life?
Bragging, bragging—boasting big and bold.

银心
公子 公子 老爷来信了
Yinxin
Young Master, a letter—a letter from your father

祝英台
爹爹说 家中出了大事 
Zhu Yingtai
My father writes that grave matters have struck home

要我速速回家
He bids me return with haste

梁山伯
贤弟 莫要焦急
Liang Shanbo
Worry not, dear brother

眼看我们也要放长假了
The long recess will soon begin

你就向老师请假 赶紧回去吧
Ask our master's leave, and hurry home

祝英台
老师 家父来信
Zhu Yingtai
Master, my father sends word

家中发生大事让我速归
Urgent affairs call me back

周士章
允了
Zhou Shizhang
You have my leave

祝英台
谢谢老师
Zhu Yingtai
My thanks, honored Teacher

梁山伯
老师 我也一同告假
Liang Shanbo
Master, I ask leave as well

路途遥远 
The road is long

山伯送贤弟一程
and I would see my brother safely on his way

周士章
也好 一路上
Zhou Shizhang
So be it. Travel together, then

你们师兄弟二人有个照应
As fellow students should, and friends

祝英台
那我们明天就出发
Zhu Yingtai:
Then we depart at dawn

祝英台
银心 你过来 搀我⼀把
Zhu Yingtai
Yinxin, come here. Help me

梁⼭伯
贤弟莫不是病了
Liang Shanbo
Dear brother, are you ill

呀 发烧了
You are indeed ill! Your head burns with fever

昨晚没盖好被子 你肯定冷得够呛 哎哟（这句没有中文翻译，加上的）
No doubt you caught a chill last night from too little cover. Sijiu

四九 你快去药房抓点药来
Go to the pharmacy for some medicine for Master Zhu, quickly!

祝英台
怕是有点⼉病
Zhu Yingtai
I'm feeling a bit under the weather

但是睡⼀晚⾃然会好的
But a good night's sleep will set me right as rain

不必挂在⼼上
Please don't worry about it

师母
你这脸都红成这样
Teacher's Wife
Your face is flushed like this

还没病啊
and you claim you're not ill

我刚撞见四九慌里慌张地
I just ran into Sijiu, all flustered

一问才知你病了
Upon asking, I learned you were unwell

我刚好有药 吩咐他去煎了
I happened to have medicine and sent him to brew it

看你烧成什么样子了
Look at the state of your fever

梁山伯
贤弟别烧坏了
Liang Shanbo
You have a fever; you shouldn't cover yourself so heavily

还是脱了外衣吧
Take off your outer robe too

祝英台
啊 没没没  
Zhu Yingtai
Ah! No, no, no! It's just

这天可太凉快了
the weather is so refreshingly cool
不用脱外衣
No need to put off the robe.

梁山伯
呀
Liang Shanbo
Ah

祝英台
梁兄何以忽然惊讶失声
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Xiong, why that sudden cry of surprise

梁⼭伯
贤弟耳朵缘上 有耳环穿孔
Liang Shanbo
Dear brother… the pierced holes on your earlobes

是什么缘故
what is the reason for that

祝英台
哦哦 这个 这个 这个
Zhu Yingtai
Oh! That! That… that

是我未满⼗岁时总生病
When I was under ten and often sickly

家母就对佛盟誓
my mother vowed before Buddha

穿下两⽿
She pierced my ears

算是向佛国讨下来⼀条⽜喂养着
symbolizing that she had beseeched Buddha for a life to raise, like a calf

梁⼭伯
原来如此 伯母虽然迷信
Liang Shanbo
Ah, I see.Though it is superstitious

却也是舐犊情深
but all comes from her deep maternal love

Teacher's Wife
山伯 你去看四九药煎得怎么样了
Teacher's Wife
Shanbo, go check how Sijiu is doing with the medicine

书院后那片地有些青蒿
Behind the academy, there's a patch of mugwort

麻烦你也去采些 速速绞成汁
Fetch some quickly, extract the juice

给英台退热
and bring it to cool Yingtai's fever

梁山伯
师母有这等退烧妙法，我速速去办
Liang Shanbo
Madam, such a wonderful remedy! I'll go at once

师母
佛国讨下来的一头牛
Teacher's Wife
A calf from Buddha? Hmm

祝英台
是 是 是
Zhu Yingtai
Yes Yes Yes

师母
真是孝顺的女儿啊
Teacher's Wife
Such a filial daughter

祝英台
哪里哪里
Zhu Yingtai
Oh, it's nothing, nothing, nothing

师母
母牛吗
Teacher's WifeA
 female calf from Buddha

祝英台
是是是 啊
Zhu Yingtai
Yes, yes, oh no no no

师母
说实话吧 
Teacher's Wife
Speak the truth.

不然我即刻让周先生逐你出书院
Otherwise, I shall have Teacher Zhou expel you from the academy at once

祝英台
师母见谅 
Zhu Yingtai
Madam, please forgive me

其实 我主仆两个并⾮男⼦
The truth is… my maid and I…we are not men

只因周先⽣设馆授徒 我十分仰慕周先生的才学
It's just… I deeply admired Teacher Zhou's learning when he opened his academy

所以⼥扮男装 前来拜师
So I disguised myself as a man to study here

师母
你主仆⼗分谨慎
Teacher's Wife
You and your maid indeed have been very cautious

瞒得甚好
The disguise was perfect

连和你向来亲厚的梁山伯也瞒了这么多年
Even Liang Shanbo,so close to you all this time,remained unknown

祝英台
我和梁兄虽亲如兄弟
Zhu Yingtai
ThoughLiang Xiong is like a true brother to me

但同窗三载 瞒了他这么久
hiding this from him for three years 

我实在对他过意不去
remains a heavy burden on my conscience.

师母
那你就告诉他吧
Teacher's Wife
Then tell him

祝英台
这样告诉他 他知道了我是女儿之家
Zhu Yingtai
If I tell him, knowing I am a daughter of a family

也许以后相处便诸多顾忌
he might become constrained and unease,

反倒不轻松自在了
then it will not be natural for us to study together considering the gender decorum

而且
And besides

师母
而且什么
Teacher's Wife
Besides what

祝英台
我和他共砚三年
Zhu Yingtai
Sharing a study for three years, I

早已寄情于他
A tender attachment to him has long grown in my bosom

我有意想说
I wished to tell him

但说了就没法同窗了
but doing so might end our friendship

因之隐忍⾄今
That's why I have cherished it sercretly until now

师母
既然如此
Teacher's Wife
Since that is the case

那你便等时机到的时候再说吧
then wait for the right moment to tell him

我看你们两个性格质朴
I see you two share a simple sincerity

每日在一起相处也颇多意趣 甚为相融
Your daily companionship is full of mutual understanding and harmony

确实是天造地设的一对
Truly, you two seem a heaven-made match

这件事我还是会告诉周先生的
I will still inform Teacher Zhou

他向来对你的文章称赞不已
He has always praised your essays highly

知道其间的原委 想来不会怪你
I doubt he will blame you. Knowing the truth will help him make suitable arrangements for your studies here

祝英台
谢谢师母 其实时机已经到了
Zhu Yingtai
Thank you, Madam.Actually, the time has come

今晨我收到家书
This morning I received a family letter 

信里说母亲病了 唤我早日回家
saying my mother is ill and calling me home early

其实大概是父亲觉得我年岁不待
Actually, it's probably my father thinking my age won't wait 

需得速速择婿
and I need to quickly choose a husband

我明日便要启程回去 不知师母
I must set out back home tomorrow. I wonder... Madam

师母
可否做你冰人
Teacher's Wife
May I serve as your matchmaker

师母 
自然不成问题的。
Teacher's Wife
Of course, it's no trouble at all.

梁⼭伯
贤弟，起身先把药喝了再睡吧
Liang Shanbo
Dear brother, you should take your medicine before sleeping

祝英台
梁兄对我实在是好啊
ZhuYingtai
Liang Xiong treats me so kindly

梁山伯
疾相扶持
Liang Shanbo
To care for each other in sickness

这是圣贤书上告诉我们的
is what the sages teach

贤弟待我 也是一样
You would do the same for me

师母
她病了需要多休息
Teacher's Wife
He needs rest now

也自有银心在身边照料
and Yinxin is here to care for him.
我们还是别在这逗留了
 We shouldn't linger

梁山伯
那贤弟有什么事
Liang Shanbo
Then if my brother needs anything

一定要派银心及时告诉我
have Yinxin inform me immediately

银心
小姐
Yinxin
My lady

祝英台
梁兄待我这样的好
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Xiong treats me so well

唯恐此一回去
I fear once I return home

再也见不到他了
I may never get to see him


山有木兮木有枝
The mountains bear their trees, and the trees their boughs.

心悦君兮君不知
My heart delights in you, yet you do not know.

ACT 6
十八里长亭相送
Farewell at the Eighteen-Mile Pavilion

祝英台
此一行
Zhu Yingtai
As they begin to walk forward

不知何时才能与梁兄相见
This parting gone what day shall bring our meeting again

梁山伯
来日方长
Liang Shanbo
Time yet remains, dear friend

贤弟不用伤感
do not be sorrowful

走 出发吧
Come, let us press on

祝英台
梁兄 你听
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Brother, do you hear

满树喜鹊唧唧喳喳叫个不停呢
The magpies, perched upon the trees, chirp non-stop

定是向你梁兄报喜来的呢
Surely, they are heralding good news for you, my Liang Brother

梁山伯
啊 这喜鹊定是庇佑贤弟一路平安呢
Liang Shanbo
Ah, these birds bless your journey with their chirping tunes

贤弟你看
Look yonder

翻过前面的山
once we cross this hill

咱们就算出城了
we shall be outside the town

祝英台
咦 梁兄 那山上的樵夫担着柴呢
Zhu Yingtai
See, the woodman on the hill, bearing load of wood

梁山伯
是呀 这起早落夜的好辛苦啊
Liang Shanbo
Aye, to labor dawn till night—a life austere and rude

打柴度日却是也艰难呐
The woodcutter's lot is hard and solitude his fate

祝英台
梁兄啊 你可知他为何人把柴担
Zhu Yingtai
But Brother, know you for whom he bears this weight

你为哪个送下山
And you—for whom do you accompany me past this gate

梁山伯
他为妻儿把柴担
Liang Shanbo
For wife and child he bears the load

我为你贤弟送下山
For bond of brotherhood I walk this road

贤弟 走呀
Come, pray, let us not stay

祝英台
好吧
Zhu Yingtai
As you say

梁山伯
来来来 到了凤凰山
Liang Shanbo 
Lo—Phoenix Hill, where blossoms throng

祝英台
梁兄 我知道这凤凰山上有百花开
Zhu Yingtai 
They say a hundred flowers here in bright profusion belong

梁山伯
唉
Liang Shanbo
Alas

祝英台
怎么叹气啊
Zhu Yingtai
What causes you to sigh

梁山伯
凤凰山虽有百花
Liang Shanbo
Though countless blooms adorn the hill

但唯独缺少了我喜欢的牡丹
The peony I seek is absent still

祝英台
梁兄 你干脆和我回家吧
Zhu Yingtai
Then, Brother, come with me to my own garden's sphere

我家有枝好牡丹
A peony most rare and splendid grows there

你若喜欢就送你
If it please you, I shall give it to you, dear

梁山伯
谢谢贤弟
Liang Shanbo 
Thank you, kind brother

你家牡丹是好
for your offer so true

可架不住路远
But the road is long, what can I do

我要抱回家
If I tried to carry it back with me

花盆就能将我压塌
The heavy pot would be the end of me

咱还是快走吧
Let's hurry on

祝英台
哎 有花堪折直须折
Zhu Yingtai
Pluck the bloom when time is ripe, ah

笨死了 梁兄
how can you be so stupid, Brother Liang

梁山伯
又怎么啦
Liang Shanbo 
What troubles now your mind

祝英台
我有点累了
Zhu Yingtai
I grow somewhat weary

我们正好在这池塘边休息一下吧
let's rest by the pound

梁山伯
也好也好
Liang Shanbo
As you wish

祝英台
青青荷叶清水塘
Zhu Yingtai 
Green lotus on the waters clear

鸳鸯成对又成双
See the lovebirds—paired and dear

梁兄啊 英台若是女红妆
Brother Liang, were I a maiden in bridal array

梁兄你愿不愿配鸳鸯
Would you with me like these lovebirds stay

梁山伯
配鸳鸯 配鸳鸯
Liang Shanbo  
Pair in happiness, pair in joy

可惜你英台不是女红妆啊
But alas, you're not a lady

我若前世造得浮图塔
Still—if I had done good deeds in days gone by

而今 只怕你英台不是女红妆 我也愿得配鸳鸯了 啊哈哈哈哈哈
I'd marry you now, though no bride's gown you wear! hahaha

祝英台
梁兄你又说胡话
Zhu Yingtai
Brother Liang, you're talking wild again

英台若不是女红妆
If I'm not a lady

梁兄怎么配鸳鸯啊
how can we wed

梁山伯
走吧 哎 贤弟
Liang Shanbo 
Let's move on.Ah, dear brother

你也是笨死了
what a delightful fool you can be

祝英台
这眼前是一条独木桥
Zhu Yingtai
There's a narrow bridge ahead

我有点害怕过去
I fear to cross

梁山伯
那我扶你过去吧
Liang Shanbo
Then take my hand—let my guide your cross

祝英台
真好
Zhu Yingtai 
How nice

梁山伯
你笑什么呀
Liang Shanbo
Why are you smiling

祝英台
你与我这么一牵啊
Zhu Yingtai
Holding your hand like this

好比牛郎织女渡鹊桥
Just like the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl crossing the Magpie Bridge

梁山伯
贤弟 你真会开玩笑
Liang Shanbo
You have such a sense of humor, brother dear

祝英台
我可没有开玩笑呢
Zhu Yingtai
I speak no jest

唉 眼前有一口井
Ah, there lies a well ahead

不知道井水有多深
I wonder how deep it is

梁山伯
井水深浅不关紧
Liang Shanbo
The depth of the well matters not, dear friend

你我赶路最要紧
for our journey must press on

祝英台
哎呀 来看看嘛
Zhu Yingtai
Come, let us look into it

梁山伯
好好好
Liang Shanbo
Well, then, as you say

祝英台
嘿 你好 梁兄 快看
Zhu Yingtai
Hey! Brother Liang, look

你看这井底有两个影 像是一男一女耶
A youth and maid, standing row by row

梁山伯
哎呀 贤弟 你是不是糊涂了
Liang Shanbo
Ah, dear friend, have you lost your wits

我明明是男子汉 你怎么把我比做成女人了呀
I am but a man, not a woman

快出发啦 这么走 猴年马月到家呀
Come now, Come, we must make haste, or we shall never reach home

祝英台
好吧 唉 到了观音堂
Zhu Yingtai
Very well. Ah, here we stand at the Guanyin Temple

观音堂 观音堂 送子观音坐上方
Guanyin Temple, Guanyin Temple, the Goddess of Mercy sits above

观音大士来做媒
May Guanyin bless us

我与你梁兄来拜堂 嘿嘿
and and I will gladly marry you

梁山伯
怕了怕了 贤弟你真是越说越离谱
Liang Shanbo
Enough, enough. You truly jest, dear friend

三年前 我与贤弟在草亭结拜
Three years ago, we pledged to be brothers at the Pavilion

就让愚兄再送你到长亭吧
and now, let me see you to there for your final rest

祝英台
哦 这是埋葬的夫妻之墓
Zhu Yingtai
Ah! This is the burial site of a husband and wife

君既为侬死 独生为谁施
If your love still lingers, Since you have died for me, For whom should I live alone

欢若见怜时 棺木为侬开
Open your coffin, and take me home

这定是一对恩爱夫妻的合葬之墓 梁兄
How touching, Brother Liang

依⼩弟之意 你我百年之后
my thought is this, when our hundred years are done

由后⼈将双棺也埋在此处 共⽴⼀家
let our coffins be laid together here, so that in death we may form one household

将来有⼈经过 看到满陵林⽊
Then when travelers pass and see the flourishing grove

也让夸说⼀遍
they will speak of our bond

梁⼭伯
你我是异姓兄弟
Liang Shanbo
We are sworn brothers of different names

贤弟要合葬也是和将来的妻子一起合葬呀
When the day comes, you shall rest with your future wife, not me

祝英台
我说可以 就可以
Zhu Yingtai
I say we may, then so it shall be

梁山伯
大不了以后我们都携娘子 两家合葬的近点
Liang Shanbo
All right, we'll bury our families close by, You with your lady, I with mine

将来我们在地下依然是把酒言欢的兄弟
Then in the afterlife, we'll still share wine as brothers

不过这都是百年之后的事了
But these are matters for a hundred years hence

今天送贤弟 只宜说些吉祥话
Today, I ought to send you off with blessings, only auspicious words

祝英台
梁兄 将来你和娘子若是生有女儿
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Xiong, if you and your future wife are blessed with a daughter

你觉得让她嫁入士族大家如何
would you consider marrying her into a noble family

咱们读书这样辛苦
We scholars study and fight so hard

不知何时才能出人头地
who knows when we'll rise in the up class

和士族联姻倒是升迁的快点
A union with the aristocracy could hasten one's offical advancement

梁山伯
贤弟何出此言
Liang Shanbo
Why speak so, brother

还是想考较一番为兄的人品
Or are you testing my morality

自从听到你不绝赞颂班昭文姬的丰采
Ever since I heard you praise the brilliance of Ban Zhao and Cai Wenji

我常想也许盛世之象不仅是社稷安定 百姓安居乐业
I've often thought: the signs of a flourishing age lie not only in peace of state and well-being of the people

还有女子有书可读 有才华可尽显
but in women having books to read, talent to display

愚兄虽无移风易俗之能
I have no power to change customs

然若天赐明珠
but if Heaven grants me a precious daughter

必然让她读书明理 得窥圣人之道
I will surely let her learn and know the sages'way

若是她能像班昭文姬那样有才情
If she were as gifted as Ban Zhao or Wenji

怕是会志在青云不在朱门
her ambitions would be beyond the bond with noble families

作为父亲的自然不会勉强她
As her father, I'd never force her

祝英台
是了 就像一直有咏絮之才的谢道韫
Zhu Yingtai
Exactly! Take Xie Daoyun, whose talent for verse has long been celebrated

却偏偏嫁给了王家最平庸迂腐 迷信鬼神的王凝之
yet she was wed to Wang Ningzhi, the most mediocre and superstitious fool of the Wang clan

虽然王谢两家是门当户对的世家大族
Though the Wang and Xie families were matched in status

可是王凝之哪里配得上谢道韫
how could Wang Ningzhi ever deserve Xie Daoyun

要不然谢道韫也不会回娘家气得大骂
No wonder she returned to her parents' home in fury, exclaiming

祝英台&梁山伯
没想到天地之间
Zhu Yingtai & Liang Shanbo
Who could have guessed, under Heaven

竟有王郎这种人
there is such a man as Wang Lang

祝英台
长亭到了
Zhu Yingtai
The farewell pavilion

你我还是要分开了 我
We must separate. I...

梁山伯
怎么了 贤弟 还有话要说
Liang Shanbo
What is it? Speak, dear brother

祝英台
我 临别想你问一句话
Zhu Yingtai
Before you go... I have one question for you

梁山伯
贤弟请说
Liang Shanbo
Tell me

祝英台
梁兄 弟家有⼀九妹 先前和梁兄提过
Zhu Yingtai
Brother Liang, as I mentioned before, my family has a younger sister.

她前些日子来信
She recently wrote to me

心里仰慕梁兄高洁的品性
expressing her deep admiration for your noble character

愿与你相结丝萝
and her wish to bond her life with yours, as vine with tree

不知梁兄尊意如何
Might I ask what you think of this proposal

梁⼭伯
贤弟为兄作媒 焉有不愿之理
Liang Shanbo
How could I refuse a proposal brought by my own sworn brother?

只是未见⼀⾯
Yet, without having met her

有点⼉⾼攀吧
would it not be presumptuous of me to accept such an honor

祝英台
梁兄才华绝代
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Xiong, your brilliance is unmatched in our age

九妹若能嫁给你是他的福分
For my sister, wedding you would be her greatest fortune

梁⼭伯
只是此事还得问过伯父伯母的意见
Liang Shanbo
Surely,I suppose we should first get consent from your honorable parents....

银心
小姐不早了
Yinxin 
My lady, it is already late

得赶紧上马车了
we must board the carriage now

祝英台
梁兄 感谢相送
Zhu Yingtai 
Liang Xiong, your escort has warmed my journey

十八里亭已至 要在此别过了
but here at Shibali Pavilion... we must part

银心 你把我马车上的琴取来
Yinxin, fetch my qin from the carriage

祝英台
弟这一走 对梁兄实在不舍
Zhu Yingtai
This parting rends my heart

当年伯牙引钟子期为知己 钟子期死后 伯牙破琴绝弦 终身不复鼓
When Zhong Ziqi died, Bo Ya shattered his qin, vowing never to play again for lack of a true listener

弟对兄也是如此
Such is my bond with you

弟前两天想着我们的金兰之交 感怀之下作了一首曲子
These past nights, thinking of our parting, I composed 'Liang Zhu'—a melody for our golden-orchid brotherhood

转交给兄 希望梁兄弹琴知雅意
Keep it, and may the strings speak what words cannot

明年暮春时节
When late spring comes

若兄对九妹有意
if your heart inclines toward Jiumei

弟在家翘首企盼你来提亲
I shall await your proposal at home

梁山伯
蒙贤弟不弃 我一定前来赴约
Liang Shanbo
By your grace, I will keep this vow

祝英台
此一别 万千珍重
Zhu Yingtai 
Farewell, Liang Xiong.

梁山伯
一路山高水远 贤弟珍重
Liang Shanbo
The road is long and arduous, take care, my brother.

四九
公子他们⾛远了 我们回去吧
Sijiu
Young master, they are gone. Let us return.

梁山伯
我和贤弟相遇于此
Liang Shanbo
Here, I first met my sworn brother

结拜于此
Here, we pledged our bond

来时四人 现在只有两人了
We came as four... now only two remain

师母
既然和你同砚的祝英台已经⾛了
Teacher's Wife
Now that your desk-mate Zhu Yingtai has departed

有话可以实说
speak plainly

你在种种事情上观察
In all your observations

她究意是⼀男⼦ 还是⼀⼥⼦
was 'Yingtai' truly a man... or a woman

梁⼭伯
他是⼀位男⼦呀
Liang Shanbo
A man, of course

师母何出此言
Why would you ask such a thing, Madam

师母
不 英台是⼀位⼥⼦呀
Teacher's Wife
No. Yingtai is a woman

不仅仅是她 ⽽且那陪伴的也是⼥⼦呀
and her servant too

梁⼭伯
这事何以师母知道
Liang Shanbo
How did Madam come to know about this

师母
是临⾏之前 她前来告辞 把这事经过同我说了 所以我知道
Teacher's Wife
Before leaving, she confessed everything to me

她说共砚三载 知道你是个品行高洁的君子
Three years of studying together, she came to admire your noble character

因此愿托终⾝于你
and wished to entrust her life to you

求我做你们的媒人
She begged me to act as a matchmaker

梁⼭伯
求您做我们的媒人
Liang Shanbo
Matchmaker... for us

师母
正是呀 她已钟情于你
Teacher's Wife
Indeed! Her heart has long been yours

梁⼭伯
所以九妹
Liang Shanbo
So Jiumei

师母
英台就是九妹 九妹就是英台
Teacher's Wife
Yingtai is Jiumei,Jiumei is Yingtai

梁山伯
青青荷叶清水塘 鸳鸯成对又成双
Liang Shanbo
Green lotus on the waters clear, See the lovebirds—paired and dear

怪不得她和我说这些
No wonder she said that

师母这是苦巴巴地暗示你呢
Oh, how desperately she tried to tell you

梁山伯
呀 我的贤弟竟一直是女儿之身
Liang Shanbo
Oh! My sworn brother... all this time a maiden in disguise

她一路暗喻 我竟不知她是女儿家
all those hints along the journey—how could I have been so blind

真是一路苦了九妹
Oh, what torment I must have caused Jiumei

先⽣知道么
Teacher, did you... know

周士章
以前不知道
Zhou Shizhang
Not until yesterday

但是昨日你师母都告诉我了
when your mistress revealed all

梁山伯
那她让我尽快去去她家里
Liang Shanbo
Then her urging to visit her home

岂不是向她提亲
it was an invitation to propose

师母那你去吗
Teacher's WifeWill you go

梁山伯
去 当然去
Liang Shanbo
Go? Of course I will go

不 师母 我还得继续苦读啊
No! Madam, I must work hard on my studies

方才能堂堂正正向英台提亲啊
I cannot propose to Yingtai formally, until I deserve it

周士章
你虽家境贫寒 却也有造化
Zhou Shizhang
Though you come from a poor family, fortune has favored you

前段时间你和祝英台竹林弹琴
Last month, when you and Zhu Yingtai were playing the qin in the bamboo grove

抒怀遣兴
expressing your feelings through music

恰好谢公和一众官员游玩路过
Lord Xie and his officials happened to pass by

赞了你们有林下风气
They praised your refined and scholarly demeanor

因此郡丞着人留意了你两
so the Commandery Clerk had you investigated

知道你是我书院的书生
Learning you were a student of our academy

又看了你的文章 觉得你文章得了建安的风骨 又志在报国
he read your essays and admired their Jian'an-style integrity and patriotic spirit

准备给你举孝廉呢
Now, he intends to recommend you for the 'Filial and Incorrupt' nomination

师母
那郡丞平日总爱溜须拍马
Teacher's Wife
That Commandery Clerk is always flattering his superiors

这次虽然冲着巴结谢公去的
This time he's just trying to please Lord Xie

但确实是你难得的机遇
but it's truly a rare opportunity for you

山伯你可要把握住了
Shanbo. Don't let it slip away

梁山伯
是 师母
Liang Shanbo
Yes, Madam

银心
小姐 我刚才路过前厅
Yinxin
My lady! As I passed the hall just now

看到好多聘礼
Such store of bridal gifts I saw

直排到门外
And beyond the door

祝英台
是梁相公来了吗
Zhu Yingtai
Is it Young Master Liang who has come

祝公远
英台 快随为父出去一趟
Zhu Gongyuan
Yingtai, come with your father outside for a moment

祝英台
是谁来了
Zhu Yingtai
Who has come

祝公远
看来你已先得了消息 这样高兴
Zhu Gongyuan
What happy face! So you sniffed it out already

是太守儿子马文才随媒人亲自向你来下聘了
It's Ma Wencai, the son of the prefect —Has knelt before our gate with his matchmakers

祝英台
什么马文才
Zhu Yingtai
What Ma Wencai

滕氏
你这孩子 当然是马家
Lady Teng
Foolish child! Who else but the Ma family

太守家 马文才 
the Prefect's house! Young Master Ma Wencai! 

簪缨世家 几县首富
A lineage adorned with official tassels and scholarly plumes! The wealthiest house in three counties

马家马文才
Our Ma Wencai

太守听说你饱有⽂学
When the Prefect heard of your cultivated mind

⼈品更不必提 堪称第⼀
to say nothing of your character, which stands second to none

真真门当户对
he declared the match a celestial pairing

让马公子亲自过来求亲啦
He has sent his own son to propose marriage

祝英台
什么马家 我不要 我不嫁
Zhu Yingtai
No, I won't take it! I won't wed

爹娘你们把聘礼退了去
Send the betrothal gifts back! Send them all back right now

祝公远
胡闹 我已经开了祖先神堂
Zhu Gongyuan
Nonsense! I've already opened the ancestral shrine

聘礼已在神堂空桌上摆列
The betrothal gifts are displayed on the empty table in the shrine

也就告诉祖先，英台是马家⼈了
informing our ancestors that Yingtai is to be a member of the Ma family

祝英台
爹 娘 此是⼉终⾝⼤事
Zhu Yingtai
Father, Mother! This concerns your daughter's life-long matter

爹爹何以不先告诉⼥⼉
Why did Father not inform his daughter beforehand

娘 你也知道⼥⼉的脾⽓
Mother, you know your daughter's temperament

为什么你也瞒着⼥⼉
Why did you keep it from me too

滕⽒
我本想问下你意见的
Lady Teng
I actually wanted to ask for your opinion

但是放过了这个马家
But if we let this chance with the Ma family slip by

哪还有第⼆个马家求上门来吗
will there ever be another Ma family coming to propose

况且马家富有
Moreover, the Ma family is wealthy, the richest among the nearby counties

你公公又任太守
Your future father-in-law is the prefect

⽐你爹爹官⾼
with a higher official rank than your father

我想 你也该愿意的吧
I thought you'd be willing, wouldn't you

祝英台
⼉对这门亲事 不愿意
Zhu Yingtai
I'm not willing to accept this marriage proposal

⼀千个不愿意 ⼀万个不愿意
A thousand times no, ten thousand times no

祝公远
什么事这样不愿意
Zhu Gongyuan
What's there to oppose? What makes you so unwilling

请问你 马太守的官还⼩吗
Let me ask you, is the position of Prefect Ma too low

马家富有 在这附近⼏县无人能及 富贵能少么
Is the Ma family's wealth, being the richest among the nearby counties, not enough

马家公⼦如今还在念书
Ma Wencai is still studying now

也许将来作官 ⽐⽗亲还要⼤呢
Maybe he'll become an official in the future and have an even higher rank than his father

难道这前程还⼩吗
Isn't that a promising future? What elso do you expect from a fiance

祝英台
好了 ⼥⼉直说了
Zhu Yingtai
Well, I'll say it plainly

⼥⼉在书院结实一好友
I made a good friend at the academy

叫梁⼭伯 只⽐⼉⼤⼀岁
His name is Liang Shanbo, just one year older than me

他⽂质彬彬 是个⾄诚君⼦
He is gentle and refined, a truly sincere gentleman

我和他曾结为异姓兄弟
We became sworn brothers of different surnames

三年以来 ⾮常得他的帮助
Over the past three years, he has helped me a great deal

分别之时 我告诉他我有⼀同胞姊妹名叫九妹 尚未许⼈ 愿和他结丝萝之好
When we parted, I told him I had a younger sister named Jiumei who was still unmarried and wished to form a marital bond

⽽且⾔九妹是和⼥⼉双胞
I also said that Jiumei and I were twins

因此和⼥⼉⻓得⼀模⼀样
so she looked exactly like me

梁⼭伯听说⾃然喜之不尽
Naturally, Liang Shanbo was overjoyed

⼤概不久就要来提亲了
Probably, Liang Shanbo will come soon

还望⼆位⽼⼈家作主呀
I hope you two elders will make the decision for me

祝公远
你简直胡闹
Zhu Gongyuan
You're so ridiculous

祝英台
怎么叫胡闹
Zhu Yingtai
How is this ridiculous

读书三年 他丝毫未识⼥⼉是⼥⼦
We studied together for three years, and he didn't even realize I was a woman

真是忠厚⼈
He's truly an honest man

临⾏之时 ⼥⼉亲⾃许他九妹为婚
When we parted, I personally promised him Jiumei's hand in marriage

堂堂正正的举动 何⾔胡闹
It was an upright and proper act, How can you call it ridiculous

祝公远
你哪来的九妹
Zhu Gongyuan
Where did you get this Jiumei from

祝英台
九妹就是英台
Zhu Yingtai
Jiumei is me. Even now

父母到如今 九妹九妹 还是这样叫唤
Father and Mother, you still call me Jiumei

祝公远
就算是你有媒妁之⾔
Zhu Gongyuan
Grant that matchmakers

你这父母之命在哪⾥
where lies parental decree

祝英台
我这不是父母之命吗
Zhu Yingtai
I'm asking for your command now, aren't I

祝公远
你是请⽗母之命的
Zhu Gongyuan
How dare you claim my authority

好 梁⼭伯婚姻的事
Now listen to me, For Liang Shanbo: not with one 'no'

不许 ⼀千个不许 一万个不许
But thousand thunderous 'nevers'

现在马公子就等在门外
Now Ma waits at our door

跟我出去见他
Come out, And face him now at this instant

马文才
千⾦果然不同等闲
Ma Wencai
Miss Zhu is indeed brilliant in literature

明⽉送影去，风细落地轻
The bright moon sends its shadow away, while the gentle breeze touches the ground softly

这秋千架上的诗真是妙极了
The poem from the swing frame is so fabulous

我也带了几篇书稿 带来请祝小姐指正一番
I've brought my own drafts to invite your brilliant insight and criticize, Miss Zhu

祝英台
指正折煞我了 可惜了可惜了
Zhu Yingtai
You flatter me. What a pity

名为文才 文章实在无才啊
Your name holds a promise, yet your articles are really lacking in talent

祝公远
放肆
Zhu Gongyuan
Hold your tongue

马文才
英台小姐学贯古今
Ma Wencai
Yingtai is a scholar in both ancient and modern learning, how could my humble work raise her praise

自然看不上我的文章
It is natural for you to look down upon my articles

小姐难为读了那么多的书
Miss, since you've read so many books

那家中⼥红 是⽆须你动⼿的吧
you don't have to do the needlework at home, do you

祝英台
不 ⼥红是⼥⽣本分
Zhu Yingtai
No. Needlework is a woman's duty

多半是⾃⼰动⼿
Most of the time, I do it myself

虽然做得粗糙⼀点
Although my stitches may be a bit rough

反正是⾃⼰做⾃⼰穿 也⽆所谓
it doesn't matter since I make and wear the clothes myself

有时候 也和爹妈做⼀点
ometimes, I also make some for my parents

虽爹妈不在乎
Even though they don't really care

也可以证明⼥⼦的事我都会做⽽已
it just shows that I can do all the things a woman is supposed to do

但做得精细 讨人欢心
But as for doing delicate needlework to please others

小女怕是就做不来了
I'm afraid I can't manage it

搞不好皮细肉贵的 英台针脚还硌人呢
For those with delicate skin, my stitches might even prick them

马文才
小姐真是 率真可爱
Ma Wencai
Miss, you are really... Eh— how utterly, delightfully true and honest

竟比我想象的还要鲜活许多
Even more vibrantly alive than I envisioned

滕氏
哎呀 马公子请见谅
Lady Teng
Pardon her impudence, Master Ma

这孩子大概春困了 没睡醒
This drowsy season does confuse people's mind

有些胡言乱语
She does not mean what she say

马文才
没有呀 我觉得令千金神姿英爽 聪慧颍绝
Ma Wencai
Not at all. Your daughter's spirit is truly exceptional—Her brilliance is unmatched

您答应我的提亲 真是我的福气呢
By honoring my proposal you grant me a worthy honor

小姐何不试下我带来的嫁衣
My lady, might you grace us by trying these wedding robes

城里最好的秀娘 费了几年的功夫
They are rafted over years by the city's foremost artisans

用最上好的蜀锦做得 金丝绣凤 彩缕盘龙
Of finest Shu brocade, with thread-of-gold phoenixes and dragons coiled by rainbow silk

小姐穿上一定华贵无比
it would adorn you in matchless splendor

祝英台
公子客气了
Zhu Yingtai
Master Ma, you are too generous

蜀锦金凤这些 我向来消受不起
Fineries like Shu brocade and golden phoenix patterns— Such splendors are beyond my station to enjoy

祝公远
不得无礼
Zhu Gongyuan
Do not be rude

银心
老爷 外面有个叫梁山伯的新任县丞过来
Yinxin
Master, a newly appointed County Deputy Magistrate Named Liang Shanbo waits outside

好像来提亲的
It seems he's come to propose marriage

祝公远
梁山伯
Zhu Gongyuan
Liang Shanbo

马文才
梁山伯是谁
Ma Wencai
Who is Liang Shanbo

祝公远
是小女在杭州攻读时的同窗
Zhu Gongyuan
He was my daughter's classmate when she studied in Hangzhou

马文才
一个新任的县丞
Ma Wencai
A newly - appointed deputy magistrate

来攀您的亲啊
Aspire to be your son-in-law? How rediculous

祝公远
哎哎 就是
Zhu Gongyuan
Yes, exactly

马文才
哎呀 我倒要看看他什么样子
Ma Wencai
Oh dear, I really want to see what he looks like

蠢人让我烦心
Stupid people annoy me

极度蠢得反而能勾起我的好奇心
but an extremely stupid one arouse my curiosity

滕氏
你爹既要见客 我们回避
Lady Teng
Since your father is going to meet the guest, we should take our leave

祝英台
不 我要见梁兄
Zhu Yingtai
No, I want to see Liang Xiong

祝公远
去换衣服
Zhu Gongyuan
Get out and change your clothes

我和你娘已答应提亲
Your mother and I have made up our minds on your marriage

须知你是马家⼈了
Know that you you are Ma's property now

别让旁⼈闲话
Do not give gossipers reason to stare

话尽于此 你⾃⼰斟酌吧
I have said this, weigh my words

祝英台
爹
Zhu Yingtai
Father

马文才
祝家妹妹且暂避屏风之后
Ma Wencai
Dear Miss Zhu, please hide behind the screen for now

此等寒门竖子 最善巧言令色
Such low-born fellows are most skilled at using flattering words

往往外示恭顺 内怀谄骨
They often appear obedient outside but being cunning within

待他日借得贵府之势青云直上
One day, after he takes advantage of your noble family to rise swiftly in official cycles

只怕第一个便要将妹妹抛弃
I'm afraid you will be the first one to be abandoned by him

今日不妨让为兄替你仔细分辨一下 免得明珠暗投
Today, let me help you discern the truth and avoid being cheated

徒留遗憾
leaving only regrets

梁山伯
晚生会稽梁山伯 拜见祝公
Liang Shanbo
Esteemed Lord Zhu, This humble scholar Shanbo of Kuaiji pays his respects

昔在书院 得遇令爱祝小姐
In the halls of learning, I was graced by your daughter's presence

其才情之高 令晚生叹服
Her intellect did strike awe in my soul. All arts that grace the mind

诗书礼乐 无不通晓
She doth unfold: verse and rites, music and scrolls; lute's strain

琴棋书画 皆有涉猎
Chessboard's strife, brush's dance, and canvas' dream

尤善《诗》《礼》
In the sweet discourse of the Book of Songs and Rites

每与论学 辄有妙解
Her thoughts— Like starlight distilled in mortal phrase

使晚生获益良多
Did teach this seeker truths unseen

令爱之才 非寻常闺秀可比 实乃女中君子
I say, may heaven and earth bear witness: No common maid, but Jiutian Xuannü robed in silk

祝公远
哦 梁公子竟与小女论学
Zhu Gongyuan
What? Did my daughter studied with you

她平日确实爱读些诗书
True, the child does toy with scrolls

只是女子终究要以德行为重 才华不过锦上添花罢了
But hobbies are trifle matters compared with conduct and demeanor that defines a woman's worth

梁山伯
祝公明鉴
Liang Shanbo
Lord Zhu,  I beseech your discernment

令爱不仅才华出众 德行更是温婉端淑
Your daughter possesses not only extraordinary talents but also a virtue of most gentle grace

书院三载
Through three autumns in the academy

她待人谦和 处事明理 同窗无不敬重
her humility in companionship and wisdom in affairs have earned universal esteem among our peers

晚生与令爱志趣相投 常共读圣贤书
Our souls commune through shared scrolls of sages

谈古今事 可谓知己
our minds resonate in discourses of past and present—thus have we become kindred spirits

若蒙祝公允婚
Should you grant this sacred bond

晚生必以毕生之力 护她敬她
I shall pledge my entire being to be her guardian and worshipper

使她才华得展 不负平生所学
allowing her talent to shine and not letting her lifelong learning go to waste

马文才
不知府上家世如何 可曾得过功名
Ma Wencai
Excuse me. Where's your family from? Any scholarly titles

梁山伯
请问公子尊姓
Liang Shanbo
May I ask for your honorable surname, young master

马文才
我乃会稽太守之子 马文才是也
Ma Wencai
I am Ma Wencai, the son of the prefect of Kuaiji

也是祝公的聘婿
and also the fiancé of Lord Zhu

梁山伯
寒族虽非钟鸣鼎食之家 然世代耕读传世 先父尝任县学教谕
Liang Shanbo
My father— A beacon of knowledge in our county's hall of learning— Taught men to read and learn the Nine Classics

晚生不才 蒙乡里举孝廉 现任余杭县丞
This humble one, Now serves as Yuhang's deputy magistrate

虽不敢言显达 亦不负诗书之训
I claim no glory, yet dare affirm: Unhoused, but never unlettered; Poor, yet rich in ink's true coin

马文才
县丞上有县令 县令上有太守
Ma Wencai
A petty deputy！here's the county magistrate above the deputy magistrate, and the prefect above the county magistrate

梁大人你好大的官啊
Mr. Liang, Oh, how high-ranking you are! Clerk Liang

梁山伯
马公子 我以为年少之志 不在求富贵闻达
Liang Shanbo
Master Ma, true ambition lies not in wealth or station

而是天地立心 生民立命
but Ordaining cosmic conscience, Securing the people's fate

马文才
哦 你的志在哪里
Ma Wencai
Oh, where is your ambition

梁山伯
荡胡寇 清中原 复河山
Liang Shanbo
Sweep the northern foe; Cleanse our Central Plain; Restore our sacred land

马文才
朝廷多得是这种清谈之辈 祝大人谨慎啊
Ma Wencai
Mark him, Lord Zhu— One of those court smooth talkers. Be cautious

祝公远
梁大人 婚姻之事 乃父母之命 媒妁之言
Zhu Gongyuan
Master Liang, Marriage is decided by parents and matchmakers

小儿先前戏言 万望你不要放在心上
My daughter's childish words were nonsense—you'd best forget them

现下马氏已行六礼之仪 聘雁充庭
The Mas have sent betrothal gifts already. They fill our courtyard

想来你是看见了的
You saw it yourself

马文才
怕是看不见 大概他只能看到自己金贵的聘礼
Ma Wencai
I'm afraid not—probably all he knows is his precious betrothal gifts

哦 一些麻布粗绸 还有一些破瓷器
Oh, some coarse linen, cheap silk, and a few shabby ceramics

梁大人 这都是你们家压箱底的宝贝吧
Officer Liang, are these your family's prized heirlooms

梁山伯
敢问祝公 令爱之意
Liang Shanbo
May I ask Miss Zhu... what is your esteemed daughter's opinion on that marriage...

祝公远
自然是欣喜若狂
Zhu Gongyuan
Over the moon

马文才
喜不自胜
Ma Wencai
can't be more exciting! Overwhelmed with bliss

梁山伯
我与令爱同窗三载
Liang Shanbo
Through three winters of shared study

已是金兰之契
Your daughter and I forged a fellowship of the soul

本想喜结良缘
Where bonds this deep took root, marriage seemed destiny's bloom

如若贤妹已经觅得佳婿
Yet if another now claims her blossoming branch

我也是想当面再祝贺一下的
I sincerely wish to offer my congratulations in person

恳请祝大人允许我们见一面
I humbly beg your permission, Lord Zhu, for one final meeting

祝公远
梁大人也是读书人
Zhu Gongyuan
You're educated, Lord Liang

难道不知女子既聘 不见外男的道理
A betrothed woman is forbidden to meet outsiders. Must I teach you this

马文才
县丞大人若缺喜酒
Ma Wencai
If Magistrate Liang is short of wedding wine

马某改日差人送两坛到府上
 I might be kind to send two jars to your residence another day

梁山伯
祝公 我
Liang Shanbo
Lord Zhu, I...

祝公远
好了 梁大人 我还是直说了
Zhu Gongyuan
Enough, Magistrate Liang. Let me be blunt

你虽是县丞 也不过芝麻绿豆的官
A county clerk? A peanut-sized post

想娶我家英台 实在高攀了
You're reaching too high marrying my Yingtai

望你有自知之明
Have some shame

梁山伯
祝公 我亦知自己出身卑微
Liang Shanbo
 Lord Zhu, I know well this pebble's place

但是我和英台有相同的志向
Born of river mud, not mountain jade. Yet in Yingtai's eyes, We share matched conviction

祝公远
送客
Zhu Gongyuan
Enough! Guards! send him out

祝英台
爹 你怎么可以这样对待梁兄
Zhu Yingtai
Father! How could you treat Liang Xiong this way

祝公远
你读那么书就是为了学会忤逆吗
Zhu Gongyuan
Was all your study just to defy me

早知如此 倒不如不让你读了
I should've burned your books

把小姐送到闺房
Lock her in her room. Now

四九
公子 那有块石头
Sijiu
Young master, there's a rock over there

你站上面就可以和祝小姐说话了
Stand on it, and you can speak to Miss Zhu

祝英台
梁兄
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Xiong

梁山伯
贤弟 不 九妹
Liang Shanbo
Xian Di, no—Jiumei

祝英台
梁兄 九妹好看吗
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Xiong, Does Jiumei please your gaze

梁山伯
美 皎皎如明月光 
Liang Shanbo
Radiant... as bright as moonlight.

我来迟了
I came too late

祝英台
梁兄 和马家结亲 非我所意
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Xiong, this match with the Ma family, it was never my wish

梁山伯
我自然是知道的
Liang Shanbo
I know. Of course I know

祝英台
我的心意
Zhu Yingtai
My heart

梁山伯
我们的心意是一样的 都在曲中
Liang Shanbo
Our hearts sing one melody in every note we've plucked

四九
可是公子 祝家和马家财大势大
Sijiu
But, young master, the Zhu and Ma families are rich and powerful    

我们有什么办法呢
What can we do

祝英台
梁兄 我意已决
Zhu Yingtai
Liang Xiong,hear me, Brother Liang: I refuse to 

我决不重蹈谢道韫婚嫁的命运
Tread Xie Daoyun's path— An orchid wasted on unworthiness

他们勉强不了我 哪怕从我的尸体上踏过去也勉强不了我
Let them try to chain me! Not even over , My dead body shall they force that vow

梁山伯
穀则异室 死则同穴
Liang Shanbo
Living, we dwell apart; Dead, we'll share one grave

谓予不信 有如皦日
If you doubt my oath; Behold the blazing sun

马文才
祝大人 我觉得祝小姐平日读窈窕淑女 钟鼓乐之之类的诗怕是读得太多了
Ma Wencai
Lord Zhu, your daughter read verses of窈窕淑女, 钟鼓乐之 too much

须知这钟鼓说的是诸侯之礼
Pity she never grasped: Those bells and drums rang solely for rites of the lords and nobles

寒门贫士 竟敢妄拟《雅》《颂》来骗取高门千金的垂青岂不可笑
Look at this vulgar, corrupting Ya and Song, trying to win the favor of a noble lady

祝公远
马公子所言即是
Zhu Gongyuan
What Young Master Ma says is exactly right

马文才
《礼记》有言 婚礼不称主人 君子耻之
Ma Wencai
The Book of Rites states: “A wedding sans master's decree disgraces all gentlemen.”

这梁山伯纳采 问名 纳吉 纳征 请期样样都无
Yet Liang performed no rituals of betrothal— No match-making, no divining, No betrothal gifts, no date-setting

却诱使妹妹和她私定终身
While luring your daughter to secret engagement

现下她又在祝家院墙外徘徊
Now he lingering by your walls

这传出去怕是妹妹冰清之名不保
If word spread of this, your daughter's reputation of purity will be ruined

不要说我马家
Not to mention my Ma family

日后哪怕是布衣白丁 万没有人敢娶祝小姐的
Even the commoners would not dare to marry Miss Zhu in the future

祝公远
来人 给我打梁山伯
Zhu Gongyuan
Guards! Drag Liang Shanbo here

死死地打
Beat him till his bones do cry mercy

让他再不敢踏我祝家门半步
That never again his dirty shoe dare step on my threshold stone

马文才
过段时间尚书省的谢大人准备于会稽西邸举办名士雅宴
Ma Wencai
When Lord Xie from the Imperial Secretariat hosts. His elegant banquet for privileged scholars at Kuaiji West Mansion

祝大人何不同游
Why not grace it with me, Father-in-law

小婿也可为您引荐一二
This unworthy son-in-law might then have the honor of making introductions on your behalf

祝公远
哎呀 谢贤婿
Zhu Gongyuan
O you do me a great honor! Ten thousand thanks, My worthy son-in-law

ACT 8
诀别
Severance

仆人
公子请
Servant
This way,Young master, please

马文才
那天我的仆从打伤了令郎
Ma Wencai
That day, men hurt your son by accident

完全是个误会 请您原谅
it was just an misunderstanding. Please, forgive me for what happened

梁母
大人 这个误会未免太大了些
Mrs. Liang
Just？Accident？Young master, to easy to say a mere accident

您亲自来解释 有劳大驾了
Yet you do honor us by offering an explaination for a trifle accident

马文才
我这次来 希望令郎能帮祝家小姐一个忙
Ma Wencai
I've come this time hoping that your son can help Miss Zhu a favor

梁母
我儿被打得卧病在床
Mrs. Liang
My son was beaten to be bedridden, half dead now

哪还有能力帮其他人呢
How can he have the ability to help others

梁山伯
马公子 您说 英台有什么心愿
Liang Shanbo
Speak, Master Ma, what is Yingtai's wish

马文才
太好了 你这么年轻应该趾高气扬 为人所不能为之事
Ma Wencai
Excellent. At your young age, you ought to hold your head high and dare to do what others cannot

希望你能写封信给英台
I hope you can write a letter to Yingtai

说明你的胸襟不止儿女私情这么窄
explaining that your mind is not so narrow as to be confined to mere personal affection

梁山伯
我不会写得
Liang Shanbo
I shall not write what you wish

马文才
不写可以 不知道谁给你举的孝廉
Ma Wencai
Very well, refuse if you must. I wonder who put you up as filial and upright for promotion

梁大人要不要看看我怎么把推荐你的人一并整死
Deputy Liang? Want to watch me destroy the one recommended you as well

你信不信我让你未来的仕途在一夕之内毁灭
Believe me when I say I can shatter your political future. Within a night

再也无法翻身
Until you're crushed beyond recovery

我做这些也不为别的
And I do this for no particular reason

就是看你才华横溢 品行高洁
It's simply that you—a man of dazzling talent and noble character

还幻想着光复中原
Still dreaming of restoring the Central Plains

而我刚好 就是思想污秽
Are everything I am not. As for me? I'm rotten to the core

喜欢糟蹋干净的东西
I delight in ruining pure things

梁山伯
呵呵 你简直在举着镜子 看着自己的心说话
Liang Shanbo
Haha, you hold a glass where your foul soul stands clear

每一句都说得清清楚楚
Each word you speak makes those black stains glitter here

再说一遍 我不会写得 我宁可断手血流
But mark me, Young Master— This hand that bled for her

也不会写任何背叛我们誓言的话
Now bleeds but writes not this betrayal's things

马文才
你不写 你以为愤怒就能改变你们的命运
Ma Wencai
You think your anger can alter your fate

你以为很不满 胡人就会忍让南方的汉人
And your discontent. Will make the Hu people yield to us Han

要怨就怨你们生错了地方
If you must curse, curse the very land that you were born in

生在这个我们汉室没落的时候
Curse this Age of Decay— Han's glory fell to dust

人人都这么虚伪 迂腐和势利
Where each soul reeks of false pretence, book-rot, and snobbery to the core

要怨就怨你们有太多想法
Curse your own fevered minds

年少无知到了以为你们不喜欢 就可以改变周围的所有人
Too simple, and naive. Believing you may reforge the world to your desire

以为靠你们两个就可以改变这个时代
And That two lone mortals could alter this era

梁山伯
够了
Liang Shanbo
Enough

马文才
县令大人 你看看 什么叫家徒四壁
Ma Wencai
Look around! Behold this barren house, Walls stripped bare by poverty

你执意娶从小养尊处优的祝家小姐 最后你能带给她什么呢
Would you truly drag a lady, Bred in silk and satin, the cherished Miss Zhu, into this wretchedness

朱门对朱门 竹门对竹门 你不懂吗
When marble gates face marble gates, straw doors meet straw doors— Don't you see this truth

梁山伯
你是高门朱户
Liang Shanbo
Your towers cage what was free

英台却是长天游鸟 不愿受你高墙束缚
but Yingtai is like a bird soaring in the vast sky, unwilling to be confined by your high walls

纵她一残羽 犹嘲你灰冷石门盈盈得意
Even with one last plume, she shall mock your complacent door

马文才
你不写 没关系
Ma Wencai
Very well, refuse the letter

从明天开始 所有人都会知道尼山书院是个怎样藏污纳垢的地方
Tomorrow's dawn shall, ring with tales of Nishan Academy, How your learning breeds the affair in Shadowed halls

会稽郡察举孝廉的人如何勾引高门的小姐
How the very man of filial piety and integrity in Kuaiji, lured a noble maiden

而祝家的小姐又是如何不自重
how the Zhu family's daughter, lacked self respect and danced with disgrace

梁山伯
够了 够了 我写 我写
Liang Shanbo
Speak no more! No more! I'll write! I'll write!

梁母
马公子你不要再说了
Mrs. Liang
Mr. Ma, please stop talking

再说我就要下逐客令了
If you continue, I'll have to ask you to leave

马文才
梁大人 你觉得我在逼你吧
Ma Wencai
Master Liang, you believe I'm compelling you

其实你在逼我 逼祝小姐啊 你在逼她死啊
No—it is YOU who are choking me! YOU who are strangling Lady Zhu

你知道她被她爹关在房间里 每天滴水不沾 滴米不进 也是悬着半条命了 你忍心吗
How can you stand this? She wastes in her prison. Her father's locked chamber. Her soul hangs by a thread of life: refusing any drop to drink, any grain to eat

还不如写封断绝信 
A letter of severance could spare her

把情断了 好让她活命
Cut off the affection! Let her LIVE

梁山伯
好 我写
Liang Shanbo
No more! Alright, I'll write

==
琴已断 瑟无音 
在天涯 御风行
莫牵挂 不相念
静处身 好嫁人
The lute is broken, the zither is silent! 
To the world's end, riding the wind
Hold no grief, sow no thought
Behave in good manners... Marry well..

祝员外

I don't believe in such nonsense

银心
小姐 你心里难过就哭吧

Miss, if your heart is aching, then cry

哭出来就好了
You'll feel better once you let it out

祝英台
他们以为梁兄给我的是绝情的诗呢
Zhu Yingtai
They think the poem Brother Liang gave me is one of severance

银心 你念念
Yinxin, read it out

==
琴已断 瑟无音 
在天涯 御风行 
莫牵挂 不相念 
静处身 好嫁人
The lute is broken, the zither is silent! 
To the world's end, riding the wind
Hold no grief, sow no thought
Behave in good manners... Marry well..
==

祝英台
你哭什么 你没看到每行第一个字吗 
Zhu Yingtai
Why are you crying? Haven't you noticed the first character of each line

琴瑟在御 莫不静好
Where qin and se play in accord, all remains calm and fair.

他们以为给我把断琴
They think giving me a broken zither 

就会让我以为梁兄对我绝情了
will make me believe that Brother Liang is being unfeeling towards me

他们却不知道
But they don't know 

梁兄给了我一双玉蝴蝶提醒我呢
Brother Liang has given me a pair of jade butterflies to remind me.

梁山伯
关关雎鸠 在河之洲 
Liang Shanbo
Guan-guan sing the ospreys fair,Upon the river's shadowed shore

窈窕淑女 君子好逑
Gentle and graceful is the maid—A noble mate the lord longs for

参差荇菜 左右流之 
The tender reeds, both left and right, We stoop to pluck beside the stream

窈窕淑女 寤寐求之
Gentle and graceful is the maid—By day, by night, she haunts his dream

银心
小姐 听见了吗
Yinxin
Did you hear that, my lady

梁山伯

银心
老爷 小姐希望接亲的路从梁山伯家经过
Yinxin
Sir, the young mistress wishes the procession to pass by Liang Shanbo's home

小姐说想与梁山伯做最后的诀别
She says she wants to bid him a final farewell

祝公远
这梁山伯怎么和苍蝇似得
Zhu Gongyuan
How is this Liang Shanbo like a persistent fly

半死不活地还让人这样烦心
Half-dead and still causing such trouble

祝英台
不经过梁兄的家
Zhu Yingtai
If we do not pass by Brother Liang's home

我便像苍蝇一样死在闺房里
I will die in my chamber like a trapped fly

祝公远
你已经是马家人了
Zhu Gongyuan
You are a Ma now

要死也死到马家坟里去吧
If you must die, go die in the Ma family's grave

马文才
祝公莫动气
Ma Wencai
Do not anger yourself, Lord Zhu

马小姐 我希望你可以明艳动人的嫁到马家
Lady Zhu, I wish for you to marry into the Ma family radiant and beautiful

反正分都分了 经过让他死心也好
Since it's over, letting him see you and lose all hope might be for the best

梁山伯
求之不得 寤寐思服
Liang Shanbo
Yet seek her still, and find her not,By waking thoughts, by dreams possessed

悠哉悠哉 辗转反侧
So long, so deep the yearning grows. He turns and tosses, robbed of rest

参差荇菜 左右采之
The tender reeds, both left and right,We gather by the rippling stream

窈窕淑女 琴瑟友之
Gentle and graceful is the maid, With lute and harp in love's dear theme

梁山伯
参差荇菜 左右芼之
Liang Shanbo
The tender reeds, now trimmed, now dressed, By left and right with careful art

窈窕淑女 钟鼓乐之
Gentle and graceful is the maid—With bells and drums they cheer the heart

银心
小姐 梁山伯 死了
Yinxin
Young mistress! Liang Shanbo... is dead
